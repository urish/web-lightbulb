Read about this project in my blog post: 

* [Start Building with Web Bluetooth and Progressive Web Apps](https://medium.com/@urish/start-building-with-web-bluetooth-and-progressive-web-apps-6534835959a6#.qf1r3ato3) 
* [Reverse Engineering a Bluetooth Lightbulb](https://medium.com/@urish/reverse-engineering-a-bluetooth-lightbulb-56580fcb7546#.puoo705sd)

Currently works only with Chrome 53 ([Beta Channel](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/beta.html)) or newer. In Chrome Stable, you will have to enable Web Bluetooth in chrome://flags first.
